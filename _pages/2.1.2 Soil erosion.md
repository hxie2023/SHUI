## 2.1.2 Soil Erosion

The model is capable of independently simulating clay, silt, and sand as distinct soil particle sizes. It simulates the processes of soil erosion in land and sediment transport in river channels (Figure 2.1.2-1). In the erosion phase, the model follows the theories of Morgan–Morgan–Finney model 37,38. Initially, the available erosion rate is calculated by considering soil particle detachments by raindrop energy (F, g m<sup>-2</sup>) and surface runoff (H, g m<sup>-2</sup>). Ground cover and crop cover are two key factors influencing the detachments. The model considers the impact of crop rotation and crop growth on the dynamic estimation of cover factors. A typical simulation example for rice-wheat planting in an agriculture grid is illustrated in Figure 2.1.6-1. In addition, a portion of the detached sediments undergoes gravitational deposition. By applying the probabilistic concept of the particle fall number, we can estimate both the proportion  of deposition (DEP, -) on the available erosion rate. Subsequently, the transport capacity of surface flow (T, g m<sup>-2</sup>) is determined and compared to the available detached soil particles to obtain the actual erosion rate (Ero<sub>sed</sub>, g m<sup>-2</sup>):

$$ 
Ero_{sed} = \min\{ [(F + H) \cdot (1 - DEP)],\ T \}
$$

The above calculation necessitates several essential variables and parameters such as precipitation, plant height, covers, surface runoff, slope, and crop management practices.
