## 2.1.2 Soil Erosion

The model is capable of independently simulating clay, silt, and sand as distinct soil particle sizes. It simulates the processes of soil erosion in land and sediment transport in river channels (Figure 2.1.2-1). In the erosion phase, the model follows the theories of Morgan–Morgan–Finney model 37,38. Initially, the available erosion rate is calculated by considering soil particle detachments by raindrop energy (F, g m<sup>2</sup>) and surface runoff (H, g m<sup>2</sup>). Ground cover and crop cover are two key factors influencing the detachments. The model considers the impact of crop rotation and crop growth on the dynamic estimation of cover factors. A typical simulation example for rice-wheat planting in an agriculture grid is illustrated in the SI Figure S1. In addition, a portion of the detached sediments undergoes gravitational deposition. By applying the probabilistic concept of the particle fall number 39, we can estimate both the proportion  of deposition (DEP, -) on the available erosion rate. Subsequently, the transport capacity of surface flow (T, g m<sup>2</sup>) is determined and compared to the available detached soil particles to obtain the actual erosion rate (Ero<sub>sed</sub>, g m<sup>2</sup>):

$$ 
Ero_{sed} = \min\{ [(F + H) \cdot (1 - DEP)],\ T \}
$$

The above calculation necessitates several essential variables and parameters such as precipitation, plant height, covers, surface runoff, slope, and crop management practices. In the river networks, the eroded soil particles are routed by advection. In each river segment, cohesive sediments (i.e., clay and silt) deposit or resuspend depending on the actual shear stress (τ) exerted upon the bed surface. If τ is less than the critical shear stress for deposition (τ<sub>d</sub>), suspended cohesive sediments deposit; if τ is larger than the critical shear stress for scour (τ<sub>s</sub>), sediments in riverbed resuspend. The exchange flux of cohesive sediments with riverbed is calculated based on sediment settling velocities, sediment concentrations, volume of water, average water depth, τ, τ<sub>d</sub>, and τ<sub>s</sub>. For non-cohesive sediments (i.e., sand), the deposition or resuspension in rivers is calculated based on the dynamic imbalance between the sand load coming from upstream and the sand-carrying capacity of the river flow. When the incoming sand load exceeds the river's carrying capacity, sands deposit; when it is less, the riverbed undergoes scouring. The model employs the simplified Bagnold method to compute the above riverine processes of sands 1. Detailed equations in this module are provided in the SI Text S2.
