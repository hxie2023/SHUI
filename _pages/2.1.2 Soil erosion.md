## 2.1.2 Soil Erosion

The model is capable of independently simulating clay, silt, and sand as distinct soil particle sizes. It simulates the processes of soil erosion in land and sediment transport in river channels (Figure 3). In the erosion phase, the model follows the theories of Morgan–Morgan–Finney model (Choi et al., 2017; Morgan et al., 1984). Initially, the available erosion rate is calculated by considering soil particle detachments by raindrop energy (F, g∙m-2) and surface runoff (H, g∙m-2). In addition, a portion of the detached sediments undergoes gravitational deposition. By applying the probabilistic concept of the particle fall number (Tollner et al., 1976), the model can estimate proportion of deposition (DEP, -) of the available erosion rate. Subsequently, the transport capacity of surface flow (T, g∙m-2) is determined and compared to the available detached soil particles to obtain the actual erosion rate (〖Ero〗_sed, g∙m-2):
