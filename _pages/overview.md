# Overview

This model is a spatially-distributed and process-based model for simulating the source, transport, and fate of antibiotics integrating the coupled water-sediment-antibiotic processes at the catchment scale. The model runs at the daily time step. It horizontally divides a catchment into grid cells, subbasins, and river segments, while vertically divides a land grid cell into canopy, soil, and aquifer layers, and a river segment into water column and riverbed sediment. The model allows each grid cell to hold up to three vertical soil layers with unique soil properties. River segments are connected, with each segment receiving input from upstream and lateral subbasin.
