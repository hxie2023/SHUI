## 2 Theories and Methods

In this part, we will emphasize the theoretical basis of the antibiotic module, while the hydrology and sediment transport modules are briefly described. Several existing watershed models such as the Variable Infiltration Capacity (Wood et al., 1992), Soil and Water Assessment Tool (Arnold et al., 1998), HYdrological Predictions for the Environment (Lindstr√∂m et al., 2010), and Hydrologic Simulation Program - FORTRAN (Bicknell et al., 1996) models provided the foundational concepts and methodologies that were adapted in our model. All equations representing processes are expressed at a daily basis.
