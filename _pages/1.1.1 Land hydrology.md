## 1.1.1 Land Hydrology
In each grid cell, the hydrology module calculates throughfall, canopy interception, evapotranspiration, infiltration, percolation, and recharge vertically, while in the horizontal direction, it simulates surface runoff, interflow, and groundwater discharge as three hydrological pathways toward receiving waters (Figure 1.1.1-1a). Precipitation and air temperature are the essential external driving functions for the model. Precipitation falls to an interception storage or the soil surface, depending on the maximum storage capacity of each canopy and current status of the canopy water content (Samaniego et al., 2010). Evapotranspiration occurs in the canopy and the top two soil layers. The model calculates it based on potential evapotranspiration which depends on air temperature, seasonal adjustment, and land use type (Lindstr√∂m et al., 2010). The conceptualization of infiltration process references the variable infiltration capacity method (Wood et al., 1992). It assumes a sub-grid variability of soil property and vegetation cover, resulting in different infiltration capacities across a grid cell (Figure 1.1.1-1b).

The basic equation of infiltration within a grid cell at a given time is: 

$$ 
i = i_m[1 - (1 - A)^{1/b}] 
$$

where i (mm H2O) represents the actual infiltration rate, i_m (mm H2O) is the maximum infiltration rate, A is area fraction of the grid cell in which the infiltration rate is less than i and ranges from 0 to 1, b is an exponent parameter that controls the shape of the infiltration curve which reflects how quickly the infiltration capacity decreases as the soil becomes wetter. Given the initial soil moisture content and maximum soil moisture content, the throughfall will be divided to surface runoff and infiltration based on the infiltration capacities (Figure 2 b). The generated surface runoff at a given time can be calculated as:
