## 1.1.1 Land Hydrology
In each grid cell, the hydrology module calculates throughfall, canopy interception, evapotranspiration, infiltration, percolation, and recharge vertically, while in the horizontal direction, it simulates surface runoff, interflow, and groundwater discharge as three hydrological pathways toward receiving waters (Figure 1.1.1-1a). Precipitation and air temperature are the essential external driving functions for the model. Precipitation falls to an interception storage or the soil surface, depending on the maximum storage capacity of each canopy and current status of the canopy water content (Samaniego et al., 2010). Evapotranspiration occurs in the canopy and the top two soil layers. The model calculates it based on potential evapotranspiration which depends on air temperature, seasonal adjustment, and land use type (Lindström et al., 2010). The conceptualization of infiltration process references the variable infiltration capacity method (Wood et al., 1992). It assumes a sub-grid variability of soil property and vegetation cover, resulting in different infiltration capacities across a grid cell (Figure 1.1.1-1b).

The basic equation of infiltration within a grid cell at a given time is: 

$$ 
i = i_m[1 - (1 - A)^{1/b}] 
$$


where i (mm H2O) represents the actual infiltration rate, i_m (mm H2O) is the maximum infiltration rate, A is area fraction of the grid cell in which the infiltration rate is less than i and ranges from 0 to 1, b is an exponent parameter that controls the shape of the infiltration curve which reflects how quickly the infiltration capacity decreases as the soil becomes wetter. Given the initial soil moisture content and maximum soil moisture content, the throughfall will be divided to surface runoff and infiltration based on the infiltration capacities (Figure 1.1.1-1b). The generated surface runoff at a given time can be calculated as:

$$
R_{surf}=
\begin{cases}
Thr_f + W_0 - W_m, & i_0 + Thr_f \geq i_m \\
Thr_f + W_0 - W_m + W_m \cdot \left[ 1 - \frac{i_0 + Thr_f}{i_m} \right]^{1+b}, & i_0 + Thr_f < i_m
\end{cases}
$$

where R_surf (mm H2O) is the estimated surface runoff, Thrf (mm H2O) is the throughfall, W_0 (mm H2O) is the initial soil moisture content, W_m (mm H2O) is the maximum soil moisture content, i_0 (mm H2O) is the initial infiltration rate,  i_m (mm H2O) is the maximum infiltration rate. 

Every soil layer has the potential to generate interflow, determined by factors such as excess moisture, land slope, and runoff coefficients (Lindström et al., 2010). Percolation amount is calculated using storage routing method based on excess moisture and soil physical property. Percolation from the bottom soil layer recharges the shallow aquifer based on the non-steady-state response (Neitsch et al., 2011). Calculated surface runoff in each grid cell is routed along the flow directions. Land cover based coefficients and land slope are used to estimate flow velocities and travel times of surface runoff to rivers (Grimaldi et al., 2010). Interflow and groundwater discharge are routed in sub-basins by the linear reservoir method. In each river segment, Muskingum-Cunge routing approach is employed to update river discharges (Cunge, 1969). Detailed description of parameters in the hydrology module are presented in Table S1.
