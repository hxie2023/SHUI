# 1 Overview

This model is a spatially-distributed and process-based model for simulating the source, transport, and fate of antibiotics integrating the coupled water-sediment-antibiotic processes at the catchment scale. The model runs at the daily time step. It horizontally divides a catchment into grid cells, sub-basins, and river segments, while vertically divides a land grid cell into canopy, soil, and aquifer layers, and a river segment into water column and riverbed sediment. The model allows each grid cell to hold up to three vertical soil layers with unique soil properties. River segments are connected, with each segment receiving input from upstream and lateral sub-basin.

Hydrology is treated as the basic module in the model because it intricately influences the transport and fate of antibiotics across different environmental compartments. The sediment module also serves as a fundamental basis. Antibiotics exhibit a tendency to adsorb onto particulate matters, making soil erosion a significant pathway for transport (Bailey et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2020b).  Sediments can act as a reservoir for antibiotic residues (Wang et al., 2023), while sediment-associated antibiotics can also be remobilized via resuspension events (Li et al., 2018), leading to its critical role for sources and sinks of riverine antibiotics. Therefore, the simulation of the hydro-biogeochemical processes of antibiotics in our model is tightly coupled with the hydrology and sediment modules. A grid-by-grid simulation is conducted first, followed by the routing of antibiotic loadings to sub-basins and river segments through four pathways, including surface runoff, interflow, groundwater discharge, and soil erosion. Antibiotic loads in the river segments are transported to the catchment outlet through the topology of the river network. Schematics of the modeling framework are presented in Figure 1. Coupling configuration of the model components and flow chart of model operation are shown in Figure S1 and S2.
