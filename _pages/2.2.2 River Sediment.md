## 2.2.2 River Sediment

In the river networks, the eroded soil particles are routed by advection. In each river segment, cohesive sediments (i.e., clay and silt) deposit or resuspend depending on the actual shear stress (τ) exerted upon the bed surface. If τ is less than the critical shear stress for deposition (τ<sub>d</sub>), suspended cohesive sediments deposit; if τ is larger than the critical shear stress for scour (τ<sub>s</sub>), sediments in riverbed resuspend. The exchange flux of cohesive sediments with riverbed is calculated based on sediment settling velocities, sediment concentrations, volume of water, average water depth, τ, τ<sub>d</sub>, and τ<sub>s</sub>. For non-cohesive sediments (i.e., sand), the deposition or resuspension in rivers is calculated based on the dynamic imbalance between the sand load coming from upstream and the sand-carrying capacity of the river flow. When the incoming sand load exceeds the river's carrying capacity, sands deposit; when it is less, the riverbed undergoes scouring. The model employs the simplified Bagnold method to compute the above riverine processes of sands.
