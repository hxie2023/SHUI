## 2.2.1 River Hydrology

By defining river nodes and connecting edges, the model generates the topology of the river networks. In each river segment, Muskingum-Cunge routing approach is employed to update river discharges. Given river channel characteristics, such as slope and roughness, the routing approach is solved by approximation of the diffusive wave with the four-point implicit difference scheme. The Muskingum-Cunge algorithm is derived from the equation of kinematic wave:

$$ 
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial t} + C_{k} \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} = 0
$$

$$
Q_{t+1}^{n+1} = C_{0} \cdot Q_{t}^{n} + C_{1} \cdot Q_{t+1}^{n} + C_{2} \cdot Q_{t}^{n+1}
$$

where C_k (m s<sup>-1</sup>) is the celerity of wave propagation, Q (m<sup>3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) is the channel streamflow, n and t denote the spatial and temporal index, \\(C_0\\), \\(C_1\\), and \\(C_2\\) are calculated as:

$$ 
C_{0} = \frac{K X + 0.5 \Delta t}{K (1 - X) + 0.5 \Delta t}; C_{1} = \frac{-K X + 0.5 \Delta t}{K (1 - X) + 0.5 \Delta t}   
$$

$$ 
C_{1} = \frac{-K X + 0.5 \Delta t}{K (1 - X) + 0.5 \Delta t} 
$$

$$ 
C_{2} = 1 - C_{0} - C_{1}
$$

$$
K = \frac{L}{C_{k}}; X = 0.5 \cdot (1 - frac{q}{S L C_{k}})
$$
